Standard IOCCC stuff
--------------------

The IOCCC has a web site and now has a number of international mirrors.
The primary site can be found at,

     http://www.ioccc.org/

Use make to compile entries.  It is possible that on non-Un*x / non-Linux
systems the makefile needs to be changed.  See the Makefile for details.

Look at the source and try to figure out what the programs do, and run
them with various inputs.  If you want to, look at the hints files for
spoilers - this year we included most of the information included
by the submitters.

Read over the makefile for compile/build issues.  Your system may
require certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a
#define).

Some ANSI C compilers are not quite as good as they should be.  If
yours is lacking, you may need to compile using gcc instead of your
local compiler.


Remarks on some of the entries
------------------------------

There were some outstanding entries that did not win.  Unfortunately
some very good entries lost because they:

    + depended too much on non-portable side effects in expressions;
    + depended too much on a particular byte order;
    + required the use of a special script, data file or pseudo-machine
      language that was not supplied with the entry.

We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.

We believe you will be impressed with this year's winners.  The Best
of Show is a fine example of obfuscation.  But don't ignore the other
winners!  There are games, utilities, programs that output images and
a one-liner that is incredibly compact for what it can do.

The Best Abuse of the Guidelines is technically allowed by the rules.
This year we allowed it due to the functionality of the program. This
entry is one of the easiest to read!  Don't assume you can win using
similar techniques next time ... :-)

This year a single person won two awards!  We also had repeat winners
with their 6th, 4th and 2nd winning entries this year!  (Please note that
judging is done completely anonymously.  Be warned that we may disqualify
entries that reveal the identity of the submitter).
