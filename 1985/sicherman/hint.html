<h1>The worst abuse of the C preprocessor</h1>

<p>Col. G. L. Sicherman</p>

<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<p>This program abuses the C preprocessor so much that some /lib/cpp&rsquo;s fail to
strip out all of the comments on the first pass!  If you were able to
understand Decot&rsquo;s entry in 1984, you will have a head start on this
one.</p>

<p>Be sure to run this program through lint!  If your lint works
correctly, it should warn you that the argument &lsquo;Manual&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t used.
Like the program says, what&rsquo;s that mean?</p>

<p>Run the program without arguments and enter the letters &lsquo;a&rsquo; thru &rsquo;m'
on a line.  Now enter the letters &lsquo;n&rsquo; thru &lsquo;z&rsquo;.  But to borrow a quote
from Richard Stallman: If you think you understand what this code
does, then you don&rsquo;t, so read it again!  Explain why:</p>

<pre><code>sicherman &lt; sicherman.c | sicherman | diff - sicherman.c
</code></pre>

<p>results in diff reporting a difference on some machines.</p>
