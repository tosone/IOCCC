<h1>The most obscure program</h1>

<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<p>An interesting use of a recursive call to main.  Compile and execute
without args.  What is the initial value of b, and does it alter the
action of the program?</p>

<p>If you let it, the program will continue to print a numerical sequence
(can you guess in what base it is printed?) until you run out of
memory or until they sell your computer, which ever comes first.</p>
