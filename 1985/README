185 marked the second year of the Obfuscated C Code Contest.

Hints against machine dependent code were added to the rules to avoid
another 1984 style winner.  Rules and results were posted to net.lang.c
and net.unix-wizards.  Larry Bassel was invited to help in the
judging.  Awards were given to 5 classes of programs since we were
unable to select only the best 4.
