<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<p>The Judges believe that this is the best one line entry ever received.
Compile on a UN*X system, or at least using a C implementation that
fakes it.  Very few people are able to determine what this program
does by visual inspection.  I suggest that you stop reading this
section right now and see if you are one of the few people who can.</p>

<p>Several points are important to understand in this program:</p>

<p>1) What is the symbol &lsquo;unix&rsquo; and what is its value in the program?
   Clearly &lsquo;unix&rsquo; is not a function, and since &lsquo;unix&rsquo; is not declared
   to be a data type (such as int, char, struct foo, enum, &hellip;)
   what must &lsquo;unix&rsquo; be?</p>

<p>2) What is the value of the symbol &ldquo;have&rdquo;?  (hint: the value is
   NOT 4 characters, or &lsquo;h&rsquo;, or a string)  Consider the fact that:</p>

<pre><code>    char *x;
</code></pre>

<p>  defines a pointer to a character (i.e. an address), and that
  the &lsquo;=&rsquo; assigns things is compatible types.  Since:</p>

<pre><code>    x = "have";
</code></pre>

<p>  is legal C, what type of value is &ldquo;have&rdquo;?</p>

<p>3) Note that the following expressions yield the same value:</p>

<pre><code>    x[3]    *(x+3)    *(3+x)
</code></pre>

<p>   since addition is communitive.  What can be said about the value:</p>

<pre><code>    3[x]
</code></pre>

<p>David Korn&rsquo;s /bin/ksh provides us with a greatly improved version of
the /bin/sh.  The source for v7&rsquo;s /bin/sh greatly inspired this contest.</p>
