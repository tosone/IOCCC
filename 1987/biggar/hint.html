<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<h3>To build:</h3>

<pre><code>cc -DC="R&gt;0" -DI="if(T)O" -DO="c=write(1,&amp;c,1);" -DP="main(){X}"\
-DR="read(0,&amp;c,1)" -DT="c!=015" -DW="while(C)I" -DX="char c;W" markb.c
</code></pre>

<p>Passes BSD and UTS lint.  At least one version of lint is thrown into
an infinite loop by this entry.</p>

<h3>Try:</h3>

<pre><code>... | markb | od -c (remember to compile as indicated above)
</code></pre>

<p>By changing the compile line you can make this program do anything you
want.  This is a very efficient way to transfer source, though it
increases the size of Makefiles.</p>

<p>With only slight variations, this program can be set to many uses.
Consider how easy it would be to release Un*x source in this form;
so what if the make files grow a little!  :-)</p>

<p>One vendor&rsquo;s lint got hung in an infinite loop over this entry!</p>

<blockquote><p>FYI:  We will let Mark get away with this truly sick entry this time, but
for the future on we have placed a limit on the size of a compile line.</p></blockquote>
