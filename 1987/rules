Subject: 4th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Rules
Newsgroups: comp.lang.c,comp.unix.wizards
Keywords: rules,1987,obfuscate,contest

GOALS OF THE CONTEST:

	* To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
	* To show what should NOT be done in C programs.
	* To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)

RULES:
	1) The source must be 1024 characters long or less.  NO EXCEPTIONS!

	2) To help us process your entries, we ask that you submit entries
	   in the following format:   (please include the --- lines)

---start of header items---
name:
org:
email address:
postal address:
environment:
remarks:
---start of entry---
X	<place obfuscated source of 1024 characters or less here>
X	<add a leading X to each line to avoid problems with mailers>
X	<leading X's do not count toward the source character count>
X	<the first X of each source line will be removed prior to compilation>
X	<newlines count as 1 character>
X	<assume a standard 8 character tab stop>
---end of entry---

	3) Regarding the header items:

	    * All header items except 'remark' are optional.  If you do not
	      wish to answer an item, indicate so by the string:   ***NONE***
	      Any text outside of the above format will be kept confidential.

	    * You can remain anonymous.   If the name item is:  ***ANONYMOUS***
	      all items except the 'remarks' item will not be relased.

	    * Indicate the name of your Company or School in the 'org' item.

	    * The 'email address' item asks for a network path from a major
	      site (such as amdahl) to your mailbox.

	    * If you give a 'postal address', please include your Country.

	    * Give the machine and operating system (i.e., Un*x version) on
	      which your program ran.

	    * The 'remarks' item is not optional.  Please indicate:
		- how to execute or compile if something special is required
		- type of input or argument needed, if applicable
		- what this program does
		- any other remarks you wish to make

	    * If you need more than one line on a header item, place
	      tab or space characters at the beginning of each additional line.

	4) The entry should be written in a common C. (K&R + common extensions)

	5) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be
	   in the public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.

	6) Entries must be received before 30-May-87 0:00 GMT.
	   Email your entries to:
	   
			...!amdahl!obfuscate

	   Amdahl talks to hplabs, decwrl, pyramid, seismo and cbosgd.
	   We will attempt to Email a confirmation of receipt of contest
	   entries, however since Email is not reliable you may not receive it.
	   People are encouraged to submit entries via Email, however
	   one may mail entries the following postal address:

		Landon Curt Noll
		Amdahl Corp.
		1250 E. Arques Ave.   M/S 316
		P.O. Box 3470
		Sunnyvale, CA
		94088-3470
		U.S.A.

	  Write the words: "International Obfuscated C Code Contest" near the
	  bottom left corner of the envelope.

	8) Contest entries sent in by post should indicate where TAB characters
	   are to be placed, otherwise space characters will be assumed.  Each
	   line will be assumed to contain a newline character.  The leading
	   'X' will serve to indicate where each source line starts.

	9) Each person may submit up to 5 entries.  Multiple entries must
	   be sent in separate Email letters or postal envelopes.

	10) People are encouraged to examine winners of the previous
	    contests.  A copy of these entries was posted to mod.sources
	    on or about 12-Mar-87.  Contact the mod.sources moderator
	    if you missed that article.  Keep in mind that rules change from
	    year to year, so some winning entries may not be valid
	    entries this year.  Also what was unique and novel one
	    year can get 'old' the next year.


ANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:

	* First announcement will be at the Summer 87 Usenix BOF.

	* An announcement will be posted to mod.announce near
	  mid June 1987 stating to which newsgroup the winners
	  have been posted.

	* An article containing the winning entries will be published
	  in a future issue of the "Micro/Systems Journal".

	* Winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)


JUDGING:
	Awards will be given to the best entry in a number of categories.
	The actual category list will vary depending on the types of entries
	we receive.  At the moment, we are considering using the following:

		* The best small one line program
		* The most obscure algorithm
		* The worst abuse of the C preprocessor  (note warnings below)
		* The strangest source layout
		* The most useful obfuscated program
		* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>

	Extra points will be given for programs which:

		* pass lint without complaint
		* do something quasi-interesting
		* are portable
		* are unique in their obfuscation style
		* are concise

	Points will be taken away for programs that:

		* are very hardware or Un*x version specific
		* dump core or have compiler warnings
		  (we won't take points away if you warn us in the remark item)
		* fail to compile
		* obfuscate only by overuse of #defines
		  (you should do this ONLY if your use is unusual)
		* are similar to previous winners
		* are similar to previous losers  :-)

	The Judging will be done by Landon Noll and Larry Bassel.  
	Comments & questions (not entries) about the contest can be Emailed to:
