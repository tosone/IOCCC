<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<p>Putchar must exist in the C library and not just as a macro.
If it fails to compile, add the line:  <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>  at the
top of the program.</p>

<p>Line by line symmetry performed better than any C beautifier.  Think
of if it as a C ink blot.  :-)</p>
