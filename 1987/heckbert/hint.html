<pre><code>ph 40 &lt; ph.c &gt; foo.c; cc foo.c -o ph

<p>The judges used this program to fold up very long lines which the
BSD fold(1) was unable to process.  This program has been added
to the contest tool chest.</p>

<p>On System V systems, compile with: <code>-Dindex=strchr</code>
To compile on a 16 bit machine, change 300000&rsquo;s to 30000.</p>
