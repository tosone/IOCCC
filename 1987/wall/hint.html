<p>What we found amazing was how the flow of control was transferred
between subroutines.  Careful inspection will show that the array of
pointers to functions named &lsquo;vi&rsquo; refers to functions which seem to not
be directly called.  Even so, these pointers to functions are being
used as an argument to signal.  Can you determine why this is being
done and how it is being exploited?</p>

<p>Some compilers complained about this file, so we changed: &lsquo;=++I&rsquo; to &lsquo;= ++I&rsquo;.</p>
