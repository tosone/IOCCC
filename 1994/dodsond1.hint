    The program plays the game that the layout of the source implies.
    The source, on the other hand, implies a language along the
    lines of Lisp.  :-)


Selected notes from the author:

    For each turn, the board is displayed and the player is prompted for
    a move.  Enter your move as an upper-case  character followed by a number.

    The program uses a single function for 4 different purposes -- to
    determine if a valid move exists, to verify that a move is valid, to
    make a move, and to determine the value of a move.
