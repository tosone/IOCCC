The maximum size of entries was raised from 1024 to 1536 bytes, however
smaller entries were encouraged.  Due to the "Best Abuse of the Rules"
winner of 1987, a limit of 160 chars in the compile line was introduced.

This year, the Grand Prize was given to the most unusual entry and best
abuse of the C Preprocessor rather than the most well rounded entry.

Rules and results were posted to comp.lang.c, comp.sources.unix and
alt.sources.  The 1988 winners will be published in the Micro/Systems 
Journal.  

Winning entries for previous years were repackaged with each year
being in its own directory.  Make files and hints were also provided.
The package was posted to the: comp.sources.unix newsgroup.  They are
also available on a wide number of Usenet archive sites.
