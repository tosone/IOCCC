<h1>Second place award</h1>

<p>Dave Decot</p>

<h2>Compile with:</h2>

<pre><code>cc decot.c -o decot -lm
</code></pre>

<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<p>Some new compilers disliked line 15 of the source, so we changed it from:</p>

<pre><code>for(signal=0;*k * x * __FILE__ *i;) do {
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>for(signal=0;*k *x * __FILE__ *i;) do {
</code></pre>

<p>This program prints out a string of garbage.</p>

<p>The judges also offer this one comment: understand comments!</p>
