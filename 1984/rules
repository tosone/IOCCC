I'm sure you have all seen gross, or down right structurally obscene C
source code before.  Some people who deal with various parts of the
UN*X  source wonder if some folks try rather hard to produce such
down right smelly code.

Now you have the chance to compete with the worst C hackers around
by sending in your own obfuscated C program.  Just follow the contest
rules below:
		1) the source file must be no more than 512 bytes long

		2) mail your source to:    hplabs!nsc!chongo
		   no later than April 11, 1984.  entries posted to
		   the net will NOT be accepted.  please give your
		   letter the subject of: obfuscated C code contest.

		3) winning entries will be posted to net.lang.c after
		   April 12, 1894.  (thats the prize folks)

		4) indicate your net address in the text of your
		   entry, this will be used to give credit unless
		   you indicate that you want to remain anonymous.

		5) entries must be of original work.  (dont send anything
		   that might upset Big Brother Bell)  all entries are
		   public domain.  (who would want to own them anyway?!)

Entries will be judged for: violations of structured programming, non-clarity,
and use of "by the K&R book" C. (use of local mods to C are not encouraged)
extra credit if they can be compiled using the 4.2BSD C compiler on our VAX 780,
but dont let the lack of a 780 or 4.2 discourage you!
