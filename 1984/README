In 1984, the first contest was held.  The name of the contest was simply
``Obfuscated C Code Contest''.

Restrictions against machine dependent code were not in the rules in 1984.
The source file size restriction was only 512 bytes.  Rules and results
were posted to net.lang.c and net.unix-wizards.
