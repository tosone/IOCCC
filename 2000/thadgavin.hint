Judges' Comments:

    To build:

	make thadgavin

    To run:

	./thadgavin

    This entry is a nice play by the rules. It can use curses, if the
    SDL graphic library is not present, and is quite good at that,
    but the colors used in graphic mode (16 bit depth) are unfortunately
    less than dazzling. We could not test this entry in DOS mode.


Selected Author's Comments:

    To run under DOS:

        Compile using DJGPP as follows:

        gcc thadgavin.c -o thadgavin.exe -Wall -lm -O6 -mpentium -fomit-frame-pointer
-ffast-math

    To run under Windows, X-Windows or MacOS using the
    Simple DirectMedia Layer:

        For example:

        gcc -O6 -lpthread -g -o thadgavin thadgavin.c -lSDL -DSDL -lm


    In gcc you may get the following warning:

	prog.c:46: warning: passing arg 2 of `SDL_SetColors' from incompatible
	pointer type

    In Microsoft Visual Studio you may get warnings as follows:

	prog.c(46) : warning C4133: 'function' : incompatible types - from 'unsigned
	char *' to 'struct SDL_Color *'
	prog.c(63) : warning C4026: function declared with formal parameter list
	prog.c(77) : warning C4244: '=' : conversion from 'double ' to 'unsigned
	char ', possible loss of data


    But don't worry, this is completely normal.

    Recommended dosage:

	At least 3 minutes taken 3 times a day when tired.

	Do not exceed 3 times recommended dose.  May cause
	sickness, dizziness, nausea.
