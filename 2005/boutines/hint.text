### To build

        cc -o boutines boutines.c

### To run

You will need an [SVG] viewer. Look here to find some [SVG Viewer Implementations].

   [SVG]: http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/
   [SVG Viewer Implementations]: http://wiki.svg.org/Viewer_Implementations

The following will create an SVG file,

        perl -e 'map{print rand," ",rand,"n";}(1..20);' | ./boutines > test.svg

Can you explain the author's remark "[generated files] are not as scalable as their name suggests"?

## Author's Comments

_In memory of my father Pierre Boutines-Vignard._

### Walkthrough

My program works as follows:

**Input**
> a list of 2D points in the unit square

**Output**
> a Voronoi diagram of the set as an [SVG] stream

This will possibly save a compressed SVG file and may be useful:

        ./boutines | gzip > result.svgz

Input consists of a list of floating points values separated by whitespaces
(ranging preferably in [0,1]). Alternating an horizontal coordinate, a
whitespace then the other coordinate (pointing downwards in the resulting
graph) and a newline will just go fine :

        0 0
        0 1
        1 0
        1 1
        .5 .5

Strictly speaking, you have to provide a **set** of points. If there are
duplicates in the list, there is no guarantee on the one to be shown (in
addition their labels will overlap) in the resulting colored Voronoi diagram.

### Caution

This program might have been a lot shorter, but nearly impractical even for
medium sized datasets. On the other hand it could have been a lot faster, but
hard to qualify under the IOCCC size limit. So guess what I did a compromise
favoring innermost obfuscation, sacrificing sometimes speed and other tedious
factors.

Therefore this entry is limited to

> ![floor\bigg(\frac{10^6}{4\times(sizeof(double)+1)}-1\bigg)](eqn.png)

points and won't even be suitable for more than a few thousand : although
generated files do pass [W3C SVG Validator], and are highly compressible,
they are not as scalable as their name suggestsâ€¦ For serious applications
about Voronoi diagrams, see [Qhull], [CGAL] and the like : but you may
still encounter large output volumes (and have to handle some sort of clipping
in order to represent properly infinite regions of the diagram in SVG).

Beware, compilation may report warnings about precision loss, linting may be a
disaster, but the code should remain portable, and the output accurate enough
for most devices (including many inkjet printers). If you ever miss precision
on a particular dataset or peripheral, you may want to dive in and let U be
the next power of `__LINE__`.

Note : bad inputs will be sanctioned by the production of the 42nd Mersenne
prime (ie. 2^25964951 -1), memory will be kept.

### Why I think this code is Obfuscated ?

I'm quite divided on the subject because I wrote :

  * clear SVG key words but complicated output statements
  * no nested loops but loads of function calls
  * easy recursion but no clear data struture
  * easy maths but no use of math.h
  * a single if

Be sure to check the antepenultimate line of code.

### Missing Features

**Color control**
> Cell colors are chosen randomly (with a questionable rejection scheme). It
might have been useful to input them along with sites coordinates, turning the
application into a puzzling graphics engine.

**Site labelling**
> The points are implicitly numbered in the order they were entered
(starting at one). This can be overridden however, via a simple XSL
transformation.

**Site radius**
> The site radius is hardwired in the code, I still wonder why I did not
design it as a function of the underlying cell's area (which can be averaged
for free) or at least a command line parameter. Same with the char set, the
viewport and potentially every SVG property.
