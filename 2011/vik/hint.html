<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<h3>To build:</h3>

<pre><code>make vik
</code></pre>

<h3>To run:</h3>

<pre><code>./vik file.mod &gt; audio_file.raw
</code></pre>

<h3>Try:</h3>

<pre><code>./vik randowan.mod | mplayer -demuxer rawaudio -
./vik mad_world.mod | mplayer -demuxer rawaudio -
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use</p>

<pre><code>./vik file.mod &gt; file.raw; ./raw2wav file.raw &gt; file.wav 
</code></pre>

<p>It is possible to download a number of Mod files from <a href="http://modarchive.org">The Mod Archive</a>.</p>

<p>The randowan.mod and mad_world.mod files were created by
<a href="http://www.translucentboy.com">Henrik Bertilsson</a> and
are included with his permission.</p>

<h3>Selected Judges Remarks:</h3>

<p>This entry converts .MOD audio files to a playable stream
in a most pleasing manner if you don&rsquo;t like tremolo or vibrato.</p>

<p>Also it abuses the C compiler and/or assembler with a partially
initialized 32 MByte array.   Can you tell what is that partial
initilzation for?</p>

<p>Does it take your system a long time to compile?  You may want to do try:</p>

<pre><code> cc -S vik.c
</code></pre>

<p>and to examine the resulting assembly file vik.s.  On some platforms
the assembly file is about 128 MBytes in size!</p>

<h2>Author&rsquo;s comments:</h2>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In 1987,  Karsten Obarski changed the way music was handled in games and
demos with the introducton of the MOD file format on Commodore Amiga.</p>

<p>A MOD file contains a set of samples,   a number of patterns  indicating
how and when the samples  are to be played,   a list of what patterns to
play in what order, and a number of effects.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>This program converts MOD files  created  with the standard trackers for
Amiga,  e.g. Pro Tracker,  Noise Tracker and Sound Tracker to raw 16 bit
44.1kHz stereo audio.   The program  supports MOD music with 4, 6, and 8
channels MOD files with up to 31 samples.</p>

<p>The MOD format includes  many effects  for each  audio channel  and this
program supports most of them, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arpeggio</li>
<li>Slide and fine slide up/down/to note</li>
<li>Set sample offset</li>
<li>Volume slide</li>
<li>Pattern break</li>
<li>Filter on/off</li>
<li>Set volume</li>
<li>Cut sample</li>
<li>Delay sample</li>
<li>Delay pattern</li>
<li>Set speed</li>
</ul>


<p>Due to size constraints tremolo and vibrato is not supported.   Also, to
avoid infinite long songs, the position jump feature is ignored.</p>

<h1>Songs</h1>

<p>With his permission, the package incldues two songs composed by Henrik
Bertilsson, also known as Deelite:</p>

<ol>
<li> Mad World</li>
<li> Randowan</li>
</ol>


<h1>Build</h1>

<p>Compiling for *nix systems (including cygwin) is straight forward:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc -o vik vik.c
</code></pre>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<h3>Convert MOD file to raw 44.1kHz stereo audio file</h3>

<pre><code>$ ./vik mad_world.mod &gt; audio_file.raw
</code></pre>

<h3>Listen to the MOD file (streaming to mplayer)</h3>

<pre><code>$ ./vik randowan.mod | mplayer -demuxer rawaudio -
</code></pre>

<p>(Don&rsquo;t forget the last &lsquo;-&rsquo; as it makes mplayer read from stdin.)</p>

<h1>Obfuscation</h1>

<p>The IOCCC rules did not put a limit  on the entropy of the  source code,
and it appears that the general entropy rules doesn&rsquo;t apply. An estimate
is that the code density entropy of this entry is ~1.2 which means  that
there are around 2500 characters of code carrying information, yet there
are only 2037 IOCCC characters of actual code.    Most of the additional
characters are  encoded with  non-counting characters  in the  frequency
table.   But there are also ~50 or so  white space characters spread out
through the source code that carry information.</p>

<p>The use of macros  certainly adds  to the obfuscation but the reason for
using them is mainly to fit as many features as possible within the size
limits. So please excuse the use of them.</p>

<p>Once the preprocessor is run,  the code gets more interesting.   The MOD
player is basically a register based state machine and all the magic  is
hidden in a fog of short statements.   Many of the register  updates are
conditional  and the program  uses the ? operator (sigh) mainly  to save
space,   but also to leverage  the comma operator  and  precedence  more
efficiently.</p>

<h1>Portability</h1>

<p>The progam is portable to most platforms.  The only system dependency is
that the program relies on writing binary data to stdout.</p>

<p>Microsoft compilers adds a carriges return to newlines,   and to compile
the program with this platform,   the following line  can be added after
the main declaration in order for the program to run correctly:</p>

<pre><code>_setmode(_fileno(stdout), 0x8000);
</code></pre>

<h1>Limitations</h1>

<p>The program  only runs when  a valid  MOD file is passed as argument. If
no argument is passed, the program crashes.</p>
