Standard IOCCC stuff
--------------------

The primary IOCCC web site can be found at,

>	<http://www.ioccc.org/>

Use make to compile entries.  It is possible that on non-Un\*x / non-Linux
systems the makefile needs to be changed.  See the Makefile for details.

Look at the source and try to figure out what the programs do, and run
them with various inputs.  If you want to, look at the hints files for
spoilers - this year we included most of the information included
by the submitter.

Read over the makefile for compile/build issues.  Your system may require
certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a #define).

Some C compilers are not quite as good as they should be.  If yours is
lacking, you may need to compile using clang or gcc instead of your local
compiler.


Remarks on some of the winners
------------------------------

This year's winners are impressive!

The "Most in need of debugging" (endoh) is very inventive in a way it produces its own text!

The "Most likely to be awarded" (ciura) has an amazing vocabulary!

There are again nods to winners of the years:

	[1991/davidguy](http://ioccc.org/years-spoiler.html#1991_davidguy)
	[2011/blakely](http://ioccc.org/years-spoiler.html#2011_blakely)

These nods to not run afoul of the guideline:

	We tend to dislike programs that:
	...
	are rather similar to previous winners

because the entry (dogon) appropriately pays homage to past winners
without blatantly reusing their code.

...We'll stop spouting spoilers now. Have fun exploring all the entries!


Remarks on some of submissions that did not win
-----------------------------------------------

Some entries tried to get around the size limit by submitting a data
file that was really C code and then blindly including code in prog.c.

Quite a few entries suffered from undefined behavior like accessing
uninitialized locals and/or reading-writing below the stack. 
We advise running your entry through valgrind to make sure those mistakes
are avoided.

Using extra arguments to main, or arguments of wrong types as a quick and dirty
way of declaring variables is now passÃ©. Clang, for example, rejects them outright.

We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.

Some entries seemed to have a good idea, but the implementation of
the idea was limited in scope.


Final Comments
--------------

Please feel free to send us comments and suggestions about the
competition, this README or anything else that you would like to see in
future contests.

If you use, distribute or publish these entries in some way, please drop
us a line.  We enjoy seeing who, where and how the contest is used.

If you have problems with any of the entries, AND YOU HAVE A FIX, please
send us the fix (patch file or the entire changed file).
