<h1>2016 marked the &ldquo;The Twenty Sixth International Obfuscated C Code Contest&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Copyright &copy; 2019, Landon Curt Noll, Simon Cooper, and Leonid A.

<h2>Standard IOCCC stuff</h2>

<p>The primary IOCCC web site can be found at,</p>

<blockquote><p>  <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/">http://www.ioccc.org/</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Use make to compile entries.  It is possible that on non-Un*x / non-Linux
systems the makefile needs to be changed.  See the Makefile for details.</p>

<p>Look at the source and try to figure out what the programs do, and run
them with various inputs.  If you want to, look at the hints files for
spoilers - this year we included most of the information included
by the submitter.</p>

<p>Read over the makefile for compile/build issues.  Your system may require
certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a #define).</p>

<p>Some C compilers are not quite as good as they should be.  If yours is
lacking, you may need to compile using clang or gcc instead of your local
compiler.</p>

<h2>Remarks on some of the winners</h2>

<p>This year&rsquo;s winners are impressive!</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Most in need of debugging&rdquo; (endoh) is very inventive in a way it produces its own text!</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Most likely to be awarded&rdquo; (ciura) has an amazing vocabulary!</p>

<p>There are again nods to winners of the years:</p>

<pre><code>[1991/davidguy](http://ioccc.org/years-spoiler.html#1991_davidguy)
[2011/blakely](http://ioccc.org/years-spoiler.html#2011_blakely)
</code></pre>

<p>These nods to not run afoul of the guideline:</p>

<pre><code>We tend to dislike programs that:
...
are rather similar to previous winners
</code></pre>

<p>because the entry (dogon) appropriately pays homage to past winners
without blatantly reusing their code.</p>

<p>&hellip;We&rsquo;ll stop spouting spoilers now. Have fun exploring all the entries!</p>

<h2>Remarks on some of submissions that did not win</h2>

<p>Some entries tried to get around the size limit by submitting a data
file that was really C code and then blindly including code in prog.c.</p>

<p>Quite a few entries suffered from undefined behavior like accessing
uninitialized locals and/or reading-writing below the stack.
We advise running your entry through valgrind to make sure those mistakes
are avoided.</p>

<p>Using extra arguments to main, or arguments of wrong types as a quick and dirty
way of declaring variables is now pass√©. Clang, for example, rejects them outright.</p>

<p>We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.</p>

<p>Some entries seemed to have a good idea, but the implementation of
the idea was limited in scope.</p>

<h2>Final Comments</h2>

<p>Please feel free to send us comments and suggestions about the
competition, this README or anything else that you would like to see in
future contests.</p>

<p>If you use, distribute or publish these entries in some way, please drop
us a line.  We enjoy seeing who, where and how the contest is used.</p>

<p>If you have problems with any of the entries, AND YOU HAVE A FIX, please
send us the fix (patch file or the entire changed file).</p>
