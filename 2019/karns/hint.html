<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<h3>To use:</h3>

<pre><code>make

./prog &lt; textfile_that_fits_on_the_screen
</code></pre>

<h3>Try:</h3>

<pre><code>make test

./prog &lt; hint.text
</code></pre>

<h3>Selected Judges Remarks:</h3>

<p>If you typically get lost in mazes, watching this program run might &ndash; or might not, YMMV &ndash;
teach you how to find your way in a maze. The algorithm is well-known but the drawing is amazing!</p>

<p>Before running, make sure that your terminal can accommodate the whole file. Before running &ldquo;make test&rdquo;,
make it about 120x40 to be safe, ensuring that you see the @ sign as well as the exclamation mark.</p>

<p>&hellip;Oh, and the first M in YMMV stands for &ldquo;mazing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A puzzle for the reader: Can you change the program to consider a diagonal movement as one step?</p>

<h2>Author&rsquo;s comments:</h2>

<h2>The Program</h2>

<p>This program is pretty simple! It performs a breadth  first search on the
specified graph. The graph can be any ascii text file  that has an &lsquo;at&rsquo;
character, which is going to be the starting location, and a &lsquo;!&rsquo; character
which will be the destination.</p>

<p>The nodes on this graph that are spaces are connected with any directly
adjacent nodes that are also spaces. Nodes that aren&rsquo;t spaces are not
connected with anything.</p>

<h2>Compiling and Running</h2>

<p>This program usually compiles under both GCC and clang. Build with:</p>

<pre><code>$(CC) -std=c99 -o tbfs prog.c
</code></pre>

<p>where $(CC) is cc, gcc, clang, or somet other c compiler.</p>

<p>You can then run it with:
    cat <input file> | ./tbfs</p>

<p>Examples:
    ./tbfs &lt; maze
    ./tbfs &lt; prog.c</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>The program must be ran in a terminal that supports ANSI escape codes for
moving the cursor and changing colors.</li>
<li>Segfaults happen sometimes.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know what memergy management there is, if any.</li>
<li>Ths program will not compile by an ANSI C compiler: it uses for loops, and
it uses C++ style comments. It should compile cleanly using a C99 standard.</li>
<li>Breadth first search is slow (and very slow on certain maps), but my A star
version of this program is too big.</li>
<li>Lots of extra whitespace may be needed if you want to feed in an arbitrary
file.</li>
<li>It fails to compile on GCC sometimes (according to a friend of mine, I&rsquo;ve
not encountered this myself).</li>
<li>The program could be obfuscated much further.</li>
<li>The program contains some unused code and data.</li>
</ul>
