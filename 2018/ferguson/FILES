This file is a brief description of the files in this entry.


prog.c			    This is the source file to the `weasel'
			    program [1].


prog-simple.c		    This is the source code file to the
			    `weasel-simple' program [1].


test.sh			    Script provided to test the weasel program [1].


test-strings.txt	    The test.sh script reads from this file and runs
			    the weasel program for each line read.


Makefile		    The Makefile that simplifies compilation as well as
			    providing some deep magic and other things designed
			    by the IOCCC judges. There's also a `make test'
			    target that runs the 'test.sh' script. The hint
			    file shows how to pass options to the script
			    itself [1].


weasel.man		    The local version of the man page; that is if it's
			    not installed. You can still use 'man' on the
			    'weasel.1' file but 'weasel.man' references
			    different file paths from 'weasel.1'.


weasel.1		    The system wide version of the man page for when
			    (if) it's installed [2]. Note that the suggested
			    invocation 'man -l ./weasel.man' can be replaced
			    with 'man -l ./weasel.1' too but if the weasel
			    package is installed 'man weasel.1' (note the
			    missing '-l ./') would read the from the system
			    man page.



hint.text		    The source of the hint.html file [3].
hint.txt		    'hint.txt' is a possible name in the future
			    according to the judges.


hint.html		    More thorough documentation including example
			    invocations, how to compile, final and winning
			    thoughts, some of the obfuscation techniques that
			    might be used, etc. [3].


hint.css		    The CSS file for the hint.html file [3].


rpm.markdown		    This file briefly answers 'why' I submitted a rpm
			    spec file 'weasel.spec' as well as the possibility
			    of building the RPM for others (despite the fact I
			    am confident that I'm the only one who would make
			    use of it). This file isn't included in the RPM
			    itself; it remains only on the IOCCC website.


weasel.spec		    The RPM spec file for building the RPM. This is
			    specific to the entry on the IOCCC website but
			    would also be available in the source rpm file if
			    it was built.

* Footnotes

The follow footnotes are for if the weasel program is installed into the
system. As I noted before it was primarily personal reasons that I submitted
the spec file. Please note that the paths below are dependent on the prefix
used in installation; where I suggest '/usr' it is equally possible it could be
under '/usr/local', for example.

[1]			    Note that 'prog.c' and 'prog-simple.c' would be
			    linked to 'weasel.c' and 'weasel-simple.c'
			    (respectively) in the '/usr/src/weasel'
			    subdirectory.

[2]			    The file would most likely be compressed as
			    'weasel.1.gz' under the '/usr/share/man/man1'
			    subdirectory.

[3]			    These files would be in the 
			    '/usr/share/doc/weasel' subdirectory.
