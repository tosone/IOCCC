<h1>Most unstable</h1>

<p>Edward Giles</p>

<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<h3>To use:</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt install libsdl2-dev  # Linux
Something else # MacOS
make
./prog
</code></pre>

<h3>Try:</h3>

<pre><code>./prog ioccc.txt
./prog prog.c
</code></pre>

<h3>Selected Judges Remarks:</h3>

<p>Can you explain the behavior of the program when ioccc.txt is given to it as input?</p>

<p>How would the description of the state machine look like when translated from
Polynomish to English?</p>

<h2>Author&rsquo;s comments:</h2>

<h1>Remarks</h1>

<p>This entry graphically displays a simulation of sand falling.
It uses SDL to draw the interface.</p>

<p>The code makes the following assumptions about the underlying system:</p>

<ul>
<li>SDL 2 is installed from https://libsdl.org</li>
<li>&ldquo;double&rdquo; is an IEEE 754 floating-point type and sizeof(double)==8</li>
<li>The compiler supports the C99 standard</li>
</ul>


<p>In order to simulate the motion of the sand, a cellular automaton is used. The
state transition table is not stored directly. Instead, the program stores the
coefficients of a polynomial that map each state to the correct one. These
coefficients are stored as raw hexadecimal in the V[] array, and they are
reinterpreted as doubles when used. This allows more numeric precision in fewer
characters (base 16 > base 10), and makes the purpose of the array less clear.</p>

<p>The code is laid out graphically as a bucket pouring sand, and it is far easier
to observe this high-level layout than the code&rsquo;s actual function.</p>

<p>The preprocessor is used to both obfuscate the code as a whole and abbreviate
the calls to SDL. Additionally, throughout the code, the variables were named
so that they are short and easily confused with each other.</p>
