Instructions for use: Run make to compile entries (it is possible that
on System V or non-unix systems the makefile needs to be changed). The
ansi.mk may need to be changed if your ANSI C compiler is not gcc.

Look at the source and try to figure out what the programs do, and run
them with various inputs.  If you want to, look at the hints files for
(minor) spoilers.

This year, the Grand Prize won a standing ovation at USENIX.

The "Strangest abuse of the rules" award was given this year to stress
the fact that starting in 1991, entries should be shell-specific.

This year was the first year that we accepted ANSI C entries.  It was
interesting to note that the ANSI C entries were as a whole less
portable than the K&R C entries.  We hope that in future contests
people will enter more obfuscated and challenging ANSI C programs.

We would like to thank Barbara Frezza (loving wife of Larry Bassel) for
her role as official chef of the contest.  Her opinions regarding
some of the contest entries were appreciated.

Rules and results were posted to comp.lang.c, comp.sources.unix, and
alt.sources.  They have been made available on a wide number of Usenet
archive sites such as uunet.
