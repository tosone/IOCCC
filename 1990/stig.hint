Judges' comments:

    We changed the alias that the author's suggested alias from a
    C-shell alias to a Korn shell alias because many C-shells
    did not allow Stig Hemmer's form of aliasing.  (The error 
    may have also been due to some uucp site corrupting his 
    entry) Below is the author's 'how to compile' sections as 
    mailed to us:

    ---how to ANSI compile---
    Xecho alias c cc -E -o o.c shst.c -"\''Dc=main(){printf("\"N%sested E
    Ccomments allowed.\\n\",'/*/*/0*/**/'1?\"\":\"o n\"");}'\'';cc -o c o.c'
    Xsource shst.c"|csh
    ---how to common compile---
    Xecho alias c cc -E -o o.c shst.c -"\''Dc=main(){printf("\"N%sested E
    Ccomments allowed.\\n\",'/*/*/0*/**/'1?\"\":\"o n\"");}'\'';cc -o c o.c'
    Xsource shst.c"|csh

    Note that shst.c is renamed to stig.c in the distribution.

    Producing an equivalent C-shell alias or /bin/sh function
    is left as an exercise to the reader.

WARNING: This program's 'how to compile' is too specific to a particular
	 shell.  The obfuscation of this program to more related to
	 shell obfuscation than C obfuscation.  This type of entry will 
	 not be permitted in future contests.

Selected notes from the author:

    If you like shell programming you may also admire my
    creative quoting. (I use echo to create an alias
    which when run calls cc with the -D option to create a
    C macro with double quotes in it. ARRRRRGGGHHH!)

    The program is totally portable, but the compile
    commands are very shell specific so don't be TOO mad
    at me if they don't work for you.

    If you want to put these commands in a Makefile you
    must add 4 - four - backslashes at the end on first
    line. (At least that's what works here.)

    If everything works correctly it create an executable
    named c which checks whether your compiler supports
    nested comments. I've stolen the "/*/*/0*/**/1" from
    somewhere so don't give me any points for it. Of
    course neither ANSI nor K&R support nested comments
    when properly implemented, but what the heck.
