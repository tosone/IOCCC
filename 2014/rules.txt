| Most of the changes from the previous IOCCC rules
| been marked with a "|" on the left hand side of the line.


GOALS OF THE CONTEST:

    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
    * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)

| The 23rd IOCCC contest entry window is:

|   2014-Sep-01 02:03:04 UTC to 2014-Oct-19 18:17:16 UTC

|   These rules are provisional, and might be adjusted.

|   The final rules will be availble along with the submission server and
|   updated iocccsize.c tool on or slightly before 2014-Sep-15 15:15:15 UTC.


RULES:

    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:

    1) Your entry must be a complete program.

    2) The size of your program source must be <= 4096 bytes in length.

       When your program source is fed as input to the current IOCCC size
       tool, and the IOCCC size tool -i command line option is used, the value
       printed should be <= 2053.

       The source to the current IOCCC size tool is found at this URL:

|         http://www.ioccc.org/2014/iocccsize.c

    3) Submissions should be performed using the instructions outlined at:

           https://submit.ioccc.org/

|      That URL should be active on or slightly before 2014-Sep-15 15:15:15 UTC

    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:

        Your 'build' instructions will be incorporated into a makefile.

        Your source code will be renamed from prog.c to a name
        of our choice (usually related to your family name or
        anonymous) followed by a optional digit if there are conflicting
        winning entries.  The resulting binary will be renamed from prog to a
        equivalent of our choice.

        If needed, indicate in your remarks file how your entry
        must be changed to accommodate the above.

    5) Your entry must not modify the content or filename of any part of your
       original entry including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile
       (we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data
       files you submit.

       If you entry wishes to modify such content, it must first copy the
       file to a new filename and then modify that copy.

|   6) I am not a rule, I am a free being!!

|      while (!understand(ioccc(rule(number(6))))) { laugh(); }

    7) The obfuscated C program must be an original work that you own.

       You (the authors) must own the contents of your submission OR
       you must have permission from the owners to submit their content
       under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported
       (CC BY-SA 3.0) license (see rule 18).

       If you submit any content that is owned by others, you MUST
       detail that ownership (i.e., who owns what) and document the
       permission you obtained.

|   8) Entries must be received prior to 2014-Oct-19 18:17:16 UTC.

       A confirmation of submission will be sent to the submitter's
       email address before the close of the contest.

|   9) Each person may submit up to and including 8.00 entries per contest.
       Each entry must be submitted separately.

   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be initially compiled are
       not permitted.

   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
|      special owner, special group, etc.) are still highly discouraged. We
|      do not guarantee these functions will behave as you expect on our test
|      platforms. If your program needs special permissions please document
|      them in the remarks file.

   12) Legal abuse of the rules is somewhat encouraged.  An entry that, in
       the opinion of the judges, violates the rules will be disqualified.
       Entries that attempt to abuse the rules must try to justify why
       their rule abuse is legal in the remarks file.

   13) Any C source that fails to compile because of unescaped octets with
       the high bit set (octet value >= 128) will be rejected.

   14) Any C source that fails to compile because of lines with trailing
       control-M's (i.e., lines with a tailing octet 015) will be rejected.

       Please do not put trailing control-M's in your remarks file.

   15) When you submit your entry you must have a valid email address
       that can both send and receive email.  The online submission
       method is a two phase process that requires the use of an
       approval code. This code will be emailed to you as part of
       phase 1.

       Entries submitted without a working or valid email address will
       be disqualified.

       The judges are not responsible for delays in email, please plan
       enough time for one automated exchange of email as part of your
       submission.

|      After your email address has been confirmed, the submission code will
|      be valid for submitting and editing the entry for the lifetime of the
|      competition.

|  16) You are STRONGLY encouraged to submit a previously unpublished and
|      original entry. Submissions that are similar to previous entries are
|      discouraged. As we judge anonymously, submissions that have already
|      been published may be disqualified.

   17) The total size of your submission: the sum of the size of the program,
       hints, comments, build and info files MUST be less than or equal
       to 1048576 octets in size.

   18) The entirety of your entry must be submitted under the Creative Commons
       Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0):

            http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

       You must not submit anything that cannot be submitted under that license.

   19) The remarks file must be written in markdown format. See:

            http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics

       for more information.

|      We currently use "Discount" to convert markdown to HTML
|
|            http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/

   20) The how to build instructions must be in make form.

       The target of the make file must be called prog.  The original
       C source file must be called prog.c.

       To invoke the C compiler, use ${CC}.
       To invoke the C preprocessor use ${CPP}.

       Do not assume that . (the current working directory) is in the $PATH.

       Use a shell command syntax that is compatible with bash.

       Assume that commands commonly found in POSIX-like / Linux-like systems
       are available in the search path.

       Do not assume any particular given value of ${CFLAGS} or other
       commonly used make variables.

   21) Your entry must not create nor modify files above the current directory
       with the exception of the /tmp and the /var/tmp directories.  Your entry
       may create subdirectories below the current directory, or in /tmp,
       or in /var/tmp provided that "." is not the first octet in any
       directory name.
