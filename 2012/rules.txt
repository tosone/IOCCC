GOALS OF THE CONTEST:

    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
    * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)

The 21st IOCCC contest window is:

|	2012-Aug-15 3:14:15 UTC to 2012-Sep-14 9:26:53 UTC

RULES:

|   Lines marked with a "|" indicate changes to the rules.

|   Please note: These rules are preliminary. Any modifications will be
|   announced before the submission server goes live.

    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules:

    1) Your entry must be a complete program.

    2) The size of your program source must be <= 4096 bytes in length.
       The number of characters excluding whitespace (tab, space,
       newline, formfeed, return), and excluding any ; { or } immediately
       followed by whitespace or end of file, must be <= 2048.

    3) Submissions should be performed using the instructions outlined at,

       https://submit.ioccc.org/

|	(The above URL will be active by 2012-Aug-15)

    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:

|       Your 'build' instructions will be incorporated into a makefile.
|
|       Your source code will be renamed from prog.c to a name
|       of our choice (usually related to your family name or
|       anonymous) followed by a optional digit if there are conflicting
|       winning entries.  The resulting binary will be renamed from prog to a
|       equivalent of our choice.
|
|       If needed, indicate in your remarks file how your entry
|       must be changed to accommodate the above.

|   5) Your entry must not modify the content or filename of any part of your
|      original entry including, but not limited to prog.c, the Makefile
|      (we create from your how to build instructions), as well as any data
|      files you submit.
|
|      If you entry wishes to modify such content, it must first copy the
|      file to a new filename and then modify that copy.

|   6) There is NO rule 6!  OK, there is a rule 6, but we intend to ignore it.

|   7) The obfuscated C program must be an original work that you own.
|
|      You (the authors) must own the contents of your submission OR
|      you must have permission from the owners to submit their content
|      under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported
|      (CC BY-SA 3.0) license (see rule 18).
|
|      If you submit any content that is owned by others, you MUST
|      detail that ownership (i.e., who owns what) and document the
|      permission you obtained.

|   8) Entries must be received prior to 2012-Sep-14 9:26:53 UTC.

|      A confirmation of submission will be sent to the submitter's
|      email address before the close of the contest.

    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
       must be submitted separately.

   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not permitted.

   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
        special owner or group) are highly discouraged.

   12) Legal abuse of the rules is somewhat encouraged.  An entry that, in
       the opinion of the judges, violates the rules will be disqualified.
       Entries that attempt to abuse the rules must try to justify why
|      their rule abuse is legal in the remarks file.

|  13) Any C source that needs to be compiled may not contain unescaped
|      octets with the high bit set (i.e., octet values >= 128).
|
|      This rule applies only to compiled C source.  Your optional data files
|      and your remarks file may contain octets with the high bit set.

|  14) Any C source that fails to compile because of lines with trailing
|      control-M's (i.e., lines with a tailing octet 015) will be rejected.
|
|      Please do not put trailing control-M's in your remarks file.

   15) When you submit your entry you must have a valid email address
       that can both send and receive email.  The online submission
       method is a two phase process that requires the use of an
       approval code. This code will be emailed to you as part of
       phase 1.

       Entries submitted without a working or valid email address will
       be disqualified.

       The judges are not responsible for delays in email, please plan
       enough time for one automated exchange of email as part of your
       submission.

   16) You are STRONGLY encouraged to submit an original entry.
       Submissions that are similar to previous entries are discouraged.

   17) The total size of your submission: the sum of the size of the program,
       hints, comments, build and info files MUST be less than one megabyte
       in size.

|  18) The entirety of your entry must be submitted under the Creative Commons
|      Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0):
|
|	    http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
|
|      You must not submit anything that cannot be submitted under that license.

|  19) The remarks file must be written in markdown format. See
|
|	    http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics
|
|      for more information.

|  20) The how to build instructions must be in make form.
|
|      The target of the make file must be called prog.  The original
|      C source file must be called prog.c.
|
|      To invoke the C compiler, use ${CC}.
|      To invoke the C preprocessor use ${CPP}.
|
|      Do not assume that . (the current working directory) is in the $PATH.
|
|      Use a shell command syntax that is compatible with bash.
|
|      Assume that commands commonly found in POSIX-like / Linux-line systems
|      are available in the search path.
|
|      Do not assume any particular given value of ${CFLAGS} or other
|      commonly used make variables.

|  21) Your entry must not create nor modify files above the current directory
|      with the exception of the /tmp and the /var/tmp directories.  Your entry
|      may create subdirectories below the current directory provided that
|      the name of such directories do not start with the "." character.
