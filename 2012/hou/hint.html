<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<h3>To build:</h3>

<pre><code>make hou
</code></pre>

<h3>To run:</h3>

<pre><code>./hou syntax-file file-to-process
</code></pre>

<h3>Try (Unix):</h3>

<p>The results are best viewed in a 80x25 console with ANSI colors.</p>

<pre><code>less hou.c

./hou ansi.txt hou.c | less -r

./hou chk.txt hou.c | wc

./hou markdown.txt remarks.markdown &gt; remarks.htm
your-browser remarks.htm
</code></pre>

<h3>Try (Windows):</h3>

<pre><code>copy header.htm hou.htm /y
hou html.txt hou.c &gt;&gt; hou.htm
start hou.htm
</code></pre>

<h3>Selected Judges Remarks:</h3>

<p>What a versatile entry! It can be used to check the size of IOCCC entries <em>and</em> to publish them as HTML.</p>

<p>For extra credit: what is the meaning of the number 2321237?</p>

<h2>Author&rsquo;s comments:</h2>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>The reviewer may have already noticed that the 2nd page of this program is a dense blob, which is discouraged by the contest rules. We wish to point out that a majority of state-of-art programming editors support syntax highlighting, which should be enabled when reading this entry. Anticipating that the reviewer&rsquo;s preferred color setting may produce a suboptimal visual effect, a few syntax files are provided to highlight the source code under an author-provided setting, using the submitted program itself. Syntax highlighting would also visually improve the 3rd page.</p>

<p>The code may throw a few warnings due to formating constraints. The author did try to remove warnings under gcc and Visual Studio, though.</p>

<p>The author does not own the original anime series where the embedded ASCII arts come from. For comparison, original non-ASCII art depictions of the relevant characters and objects can be found by googling the embedded text messages.</p>

<h3>Syntax files</h3>

<p>The syntax file consists of a number of rewriting rules. Each rule consists of a regular expression, a space, a format string, and a newline. All text matching the regular expression would be replaced by the format string. In case of a conflict, rules appearing earlier would take precedence. One can refer to the original text in the format string using &ldquo;%s&rdquo;. Other &ldquo;%&rdquo; characters in the format string must be escaped with another &ldquo;%&rdquo;. The space character can be used in the regular expression by escaping it with [] or &ldquo;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The following regular expression operators are supported:</p>

<pre><code>() [] * + ? | ""
</code></pre>

<p>For example, one can use the following expression to match a certain declaration statement in hou.c:</p>

<pre><code>"char"[ *]*[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]*[ ]*((=[0-9a-zA-Z_ ]+)|(\[[0-9a-zA-Z_ ]*\]))?[ ]*(,[ *]*[a-zA-Z_][0-9a-zA-Z_]*[ ]*((=[0-9a-zA-Z_ ]+)|(\[[0-9a-zA-Z_ ]*\]))?[ ]*)*;
</code></pre>

<p>The regex engine is also algorithmically efficient. To illustrate the point, ansi.txt contains a pathological expression [2] that guarantees a hang for the competing Perl engine while matching itself. Try to compare these two engines:</p>

<pre><code>./hou ansi.txt ansi.txt
perl patho.pl &lt; ansi.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, there are a few limitations&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>The only escape sequence supported is \n and it doesn&rsquo;t work in [].</li>
<li>The maximum file/rule size is a linear function of the hard-coded constant M.</li>
<li>Single-character matches at the end of file may be missed.</li>
<li>The operator | doesn&rsquo;t obey precedence rules and some extra ()s may be required.</li>
<li>Incorrect syntax files are not tolerated.</li>
<li>The program relies on ASCII.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why obfuscated</h3>

<p>The first layer of obfuscation comes from the challenge of embedding a large ASCII art in a dense blob. The entire art is composed using only keywords, strings and character constants. That results in a number of otherwise useless defines and quite a number of unconventionally written constants. While the preprocessor may remove the former, the later would remain regardless of beautification and preprocessing.</p>

<p>The second layer of obfuscation comes from the need to squeeze a reasonably powerful regex engine into the remaining area that isn&rsquo;t occupied by excessive keywords and useless constants. To achieve this, the regex compiler is written using the same threaded virtual machine [1] that parses the regex. Due to compiler limitations, the generated VM code also ends up obscured by a large amount of spaghetti branches and virtual thread creations. Finally, the VM in [1] is extended to track multiple expression matches for the actual formating.</p>

<p>As an extra tweak, the text message actually does something useful. Remove the &ldquo;Make a contract with me&rdquo; catch line and the program would cease to function.</p>
