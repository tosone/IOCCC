## Judges' comments:
### To use:

    make

    ./prog

### Try:

    cat prog.c

    ./prog | diff - prog.c

### Selected Judges Remarks:

At this point you might be wondering, [WTF](http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/WTF)?\*

    * What The Freak (polite form)

    * What's This For? (you may be wondering)

    * What the Fish (python form)

How is this code obfuscated?  Well look again:

    less prog.c

    more prog.c

Where did those underscores come from?  Well [RTFS](http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/RTFS)!\*\*

    ** Read the Freaking Source (polite form)
    ** Read The Freakin' Screen (polite form)

If you are still puzzled, look at prog.c with your favorite text editor.

## Author's comments:
**Follow this instruction literally!**

    cat prog.c
    gcc -w -o prog prog.c
    ./prog

You will do a double take.


Hint 1: Do `less prog.c`.  You will see an **emphasized** string if your terminal supports bold.

Hint 2: Do `wc -c prog.c`.  This is very long one-liner.

Spoiler: Open the source with an editor like `vim` or `emacs`.
