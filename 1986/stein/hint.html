<h1>Best one liner</h1>

<p>Judges' comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>NOTE: to avoid problems with news and mail, the single line was split
into 3 lines.  Join all lines into a single line to recreate
the original file.</p></blockquote>

<p>Compile and link to a filename called &lsquo;a.out&rsquo;.  Try the program with the
following argument:</p>

<pre><code>a.out ^N^N
</code></pre>

<p>(^N is ASCII control-N).  One some machines, ^M<sup>L</sup> is needed to get it to
output cleanly.  Your system may require another set of characters.
In time, you will figure out what it does. :-)</p>
