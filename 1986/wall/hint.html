<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<p>The original version did not have a &lsquo;;&rsquo; character in the first line.
This caused a number of System V C pre-preprocessors to gripe about a
syntax error.</p>

<p>This program is a masterpiece of obfuscation and humor.  Larry Wall
(the hacker who gave us rn and patch) asks you to compile and consider
the warning message generated by the C compiler.  Then execute the
program and type charters into its standard input.  You will see why
the compiler documents the program.</p>
