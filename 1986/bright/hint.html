<h1>Most useful obfuscation</h1>

<p>Walter Bright</p>

<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<p>Compile this program and give filenames as arguments.  For example try:</p>

<pre><code>bright bright.c
bright bright
</code></pre>

<p>Mr. Bright exploits the c pre-processor, similar variables and
excessive shifting to obfuscate an otherwise useful binary display
program.  This gives you a small example of what it is like to
maintain the Bourne shell! :-}</p>
