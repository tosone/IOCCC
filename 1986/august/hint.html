<h2>Judges' comments:</h2>

<p>This program computes a specific mathematical value.  Simply compile
and give it an infinite amount of stack space and cpu time.  Otherwise
just be satisfied with the approximation displayed just before the core
dump.</p>

<p>This program will pass lint on your system assuming your lint is brave
enough to try and parse it correctly.</p>
